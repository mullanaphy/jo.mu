================================================================================

This is my personal website. All it does is basic blogging using markdown for
making my posts pretty. Oh there's also a model for messages and I do plan on
writing a cron script to look for messages that I haven't read yet within 24
hours.

I could have the messages go directly into my email address, yet I figured this
way I can make sure the cron jerk is working and I won't get spam directly into
my email.
