  <p>Greetings, I'm John Mullanaphy and currently creating stuff at <a href="https://www.forensiq.com/">Forensiq</a>
    as a Team Lead Software Engineer. When I'm not coding there then I'm usually found toying around on <a
        href="https://github.com/mullanaphy">GitHub</a>
    or creating comics at <a href="http://www.boycottpaper.com/">Boycott Paper</a>.</p>

  <p>Outside of the programming world you can probably find me on the mats at <a
        href="http://www.marcelogarciajj.com/">Marcelo Garcia Academy</a>, streaming on <a
        href="https://twitch.tv/KandyOppa">Twitch</a>, or playing some <a
        href="https://www.chess.com/member/Mullanaphy">chess</a>.</p>

  <p>Feel free to <a href="<?= $this->url('contact') ?>" class="contact-popup">contact me</a> if you have any
    questions or requests. Help yourself to my printable <a
        href="<?= $this->url('resume') ?>" target="_blank">r&eacute;sum&eacute;</a> as well!</p>
